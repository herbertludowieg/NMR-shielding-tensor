# NMR-shielding-tensor
-----------------------------------ABOUT----------------------------------------
This program is an open source version of a script created by Dr. Jochen 
Autschbach from the University at Buffalo. The original version of the program 
can be found in the link below.

-------------------------------REQUIREMENTS-------------------------------------
The requirements for this program are as follows:
	Make
	C++ compiler
	Python

--------------------------------COMPILING---------------------------------------
To compile the code a Makefile has been provided with some preset values for 
compiling C++ code with the g++ compiler. It will create a main executable on 
the same directory as the Makefile. 
There also exists a function in the Makefile to allow the .py files to run as 
an executable. To do this type
$ make execpy
and it will add executable permissions to all .py files on the directory.
Running the clean function for make will erase all files created by the program.

---------------------------RUNNING THE PROGRAM----------------------------------
To execute the program run the main executable which will write all of the data 
to pre-determined files.
To plot the structure run the python script read_structure.py. The code was 
tested with matplotlib 0.99, 1.1 and 1.5.1. Ran well on all versions mentioned.

-------------------------------LIMITATIONS--------------------------------------
This should just serve as a friendly reminder; it has been harcoded into 
the program that for the tensor a 250x250 matrix of doubles is being calculated 
for each x, y and z coordinate. It was tested for a single tensor with n=5000
matrices and the C++ code was able to complete utilizing about 1GB of RAM.
However, python would not be able to plot the data before running out of 
memory.
